# ANDROID_LifeCycle

LifeCycle
-----------
To navigate transitions between stages of the activity lifecycle,
the Activity class provides a core set of six callbacks
: onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy().

The system invokes each of these callbacks as an activity enters a new state.
1. Crashing if the user receives a phone call or switches to another app while using your app.
2. Consuming valuable system resources when the user is not actively using it.
3. Losing the user's progress if they leave your app and return to it at a later time.
4. Crashing or losing the user's progress when the screen rotates between
    landscape and portrait orientation.
